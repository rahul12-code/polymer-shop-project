# Polymer Shop Project 

This project is a static e-commerce website designed as a showcase for a simple online store. Built with a focus on clean, user-friendly design, it provides users with an intuitive interface for exploring and interacting with products.

## Project Pages

### Home Page
The landing page that introduces the shop, highlights featured items, and provides navigation to explore the store further. It serves as the main entry point for visitors to discover available products.

### Item Listing Page
A grid-style page displaying a list of products with basic information like item names, prices, and preview images. Users can view all items in a category or filter through different categories of products.

### Single Item Page
A dedicated page for each product that includes a larger image, item details, and pricing information. This page provides users with a more detailed view of the product.

### Cart Page
A hard-coded cart page that simulates a shopping cart with pre-added items. It displays the items added to the cart, along with the item names, quantities, and total price. This page offers a simple overview of the cart contents.

### Checkout Page
The final step in the shopping experience, where users review their cart and proceed to checkout. Although it's a static page, it serves as a mock-up for a complete checkout process.
